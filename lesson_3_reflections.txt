When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?
We use a remote repository to share our files with our colleagues or to make a project open source. 

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
This is because a working version of a project can have many commits and if Git automatically pushes the changes after every commit it doesn't serve the purpose.
