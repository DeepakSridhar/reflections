When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?
We use a remote repository to share our files with our colleagues or to make a project open source. 

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
This is because a working version of a project can have many commits and if Git automatically pushes the changes after every commit it
doesn't serve the purpose. 

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Fork is used to clone some GitHub repository on the GitHub server itself ie online. 
Clone is used to create a snapshot of your repository from GitHub to your local machine.
Branch is used to experiment a new feature without affecting your working version of the project.
Fork is useful when you want to add your ideas to an existing project without affecting the original. Clone is useful when you want to
work offline. Branches allow us to expand our creativity and add new features to the existing project without affectingthe original.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
When there are other collaborators working on the same project theirchanges might result in out of sync of commits with the local machine
and hence a copy of the remote is essential to resolve this conflict and merge the commits to be up to date.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
Use other file sharing platforms such as dropbox, onedrive etc. It would save us the time to learn about Git and GitHub. Contrary to this,
it would allow us to collaborate much efficiently with the array of features available in Git and GitHub.
